# Docker Compose

In this task, you will setup a simple docker-compose stack including:
 - Webserver
 - PHP 8.1
 - MariaDB 

For the sake of simplicity we use Caddy as a webserver.
Thanks to task2, we already now how to write simple Dockerfiles.
You can take a look at `Dockerfile.php` to see how a more complex Dockerfile might look like.
However, this task focusesses on `docker-compose`.
